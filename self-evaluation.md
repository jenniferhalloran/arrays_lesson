* How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

  At this point I feel pretty good about Arrays and how to use methods on them. I got a little confused by the methods and needed to do some further research, once I understood how arguments worked I was able to move on.

* Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving on to the next lesson?

  For the extent we need to understand Arrays at the moment, I think I am content with my learning.

* What questions do you have about Arrays?

  As I mentioned before, I had some questions about how unshift and push worked because I did not know about arguments. Now that I have researched it though, I think I understand enough for the moment.
